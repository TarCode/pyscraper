cd pyscraper
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Dependencies
```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 unidecode
```

beautifulsoup4>=4.9.3
unidecode>=1.2.0
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

The scraper is currently configured to scrape Cape Town property listings:

```python
python main.py
```

This will:
1. Scrape 418 pages of Property24 Cape Town listings
2. Extract property details from each listing
3. Save the results to `property-listing.csv`

### Customizing the Target

To scrape different areas or property types, modify the URL in `main.py`:

```python
# Current URL (Cape Town for-sale properties)
URL = "https://www.property24.com/for-sale/cape-town/western-cape/432"

# Examples for other areas:
# URL = "https://www.property24.com/for-sale/johannesburg/gauteng/1613"  # Johannesburg
# URL = "https://www.property24.com/to-rent/cape-town/western-cape/432"  # Cape Town rentals
```

### Adjusting Page Count

Modify the number of pages to scrape:

```python
# Scrape fewer pages for testing
processed_listing_data = get_listings_per_page(URL, 5)  # Only 5 pages

# Scrape more pages
processed_listing_data = get_listings_per_page(URL, 500)  # 500 pages
```

## Code Structure

### Main Function: `get_listings_per_page(url, number_of_pages)`

This function handles the core scraping logic:

**Parameters:**
- `url` (string): Base URL of the Property24 search results
- `number_of_pages` (int): Number of pages to scrape

**Returns:**
- List of dictionaries containing property data

**Process:**
1. Iterates through each page (URL pattern: `/p{page_number}`)
2. Parses HTML using BeautifulSoup
3. Extracts property details using CSS selectors
4. Filters for houses and apartments only
5. Cleans and normalizes extracted data
6. Returns structured property data

### Data Fields Extracted

| Field | Type | Description | Example |
|-------|------|-------------|---------|
| `bedrooms` | float | Number of bedrooms | 3.0 |
| `type` | string | Property type | "house" or "apartment" |
| `location` | string | Property location | "Claremont, Cape Town" |
| `area` | float | Property size (mÂ²) | 120.0 |
| `bathrooms` | string | Number of bathrooms | "2" |
| `parking` | string | Parking spaces | "1" |
| `price` | float | Property price (ZAR) | 2500000.0 |

### Data Processing Features

- **Text Normalization**: Uses `unidecode` to handle special characters
- **Price Handling**: Converts prices to float, handles "POA" (Price on Application) as 0
- **Filtering**: Only includes properties with complete data sets
- **Type Detection**: Automatically categorizes as "house" or "apartment" based on title

## Output

The scraper generates a CSV file (`property-listing.csv`) with the following structure:

```csv
bedrooms,type,location,area,bathrooms,parking,price
3.0,house,"Claremont, Cape Town",150.0,2,2,2800000.0
2.0,apartment,"Sea Point, Cape Town",85.0,1,1,1950000.0
```

## Example Output Data

```python
[
    {
        "bedrooms": 3.0,
        "type": "house",
        "location": "Claremont, Cape Town",
        "area": 150.0,
        "bathrooms": "2",
        "parking": "2",
        "price": 2800000.0
    },
    {
        "bedrooms": 2.0,
        "type": "apartment", 
        "location": "Sea Point, Cape Town",
        "area": 85.0,
        "bathrooms": "1",
        "parking": "1",
        "price": 1950000.0
    }
]
```

## Limitations & Considerations

### Current Limitations
- **Single Website**: Currently only works with Property24.com
- **Fixed Selectors**: Uses hardcoded CSS selectors specific to Property24's structure
- **No Rate Limiting**: No built-in delays between requests
- **Error Handling**: Limited error handling for network issues

### Best Practices
- **Respect Terms of Service**: Ensure compliance with Property24's robots.txt and terms of service
- **Rate Limiting**: Consider adding delays between requests to avoid overwhelming the server
- **Data Validation**: Always validate scraped data before analysis

### TODO Items
The code includes a TODO note about enriching the dataset:
```python
"""
    TODO: Enrich the dataset by getting bathrooms, parking spaces and pets/no pets
"""
```
*Note: Bathrooms and parking spaces are already implemented. Pet policy extraction could be added as a future enhancement.*

## CSS Selectors Used

The scraper uses these Property24-specific CSS selectors:

- `.p24_results`: Main results container
- `.js_resultTile`: Individual listing container
- `.p24_price`: Property price
- `.p24_title`: Property title
- `.p24_location`: Property location
- `.p24_featureDetails[title='Bathrooms']`: Bathroom count
- `.p24_featureDetails[title='Parking Spaces']`: Parking count
- `.p24_size`: Property area

## Potential Enhancements

1. **Configuration File**: Add YAML/JSON configuration for URLs and parameters
2. **Multiple Websites**: Extend to support other property websites
3. **Database Export**: Add SQLite/PostgreSQL export options
4. **Image Scraping**: Extract property images
5. **Geolocation**: Add GPS coordinates extraction
6. **Rate Limiting**: Implement respectful request throttling
7. **Error Recovery**: Add retry logic for failed requests
8. **Data Validation**: Implement comprehensive data validation
9. **Logging**: Add detailed logging for debugging
10. **Command Line Interface**: Add CLI arguments for customization

## Legal Considerations

**Important**: This tool is for educational and research purposes. When using this scraper:

- Respect website terms of service
- Check and comply with robots.txt
- Implement appropriate delays between requests
- Don't overwhelm servers with rapid requests
- Use scraped data responsibly and ethically
